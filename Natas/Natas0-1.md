# Natas 0-1

## Description
*No description*
## Provided Information
	Username: natas1
	URL:      http://natas1.natas.labs.overthewire.org
## Solution
In the previous challenge, we retrieved the password for natas1, so there is no need for a password in the current description. After logging in, we can see a message indicating that we have the password on the page, but right-clicking is blocked.

If we try to right-click on the message, we will receive an alert box.

However, we can still access the page source code by using the shortcut CTRL + U. Upon viewing the page source code, we can find the password for natas2, similar to the last challenge.

## Conclusion
Knowing basic keyboard shortcuts and understanding how to use them can give us an advantage in situations like this.
