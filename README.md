# OvertheWire_Walkthrough
If you're looking to improve your hacking skills, OvertheWire is an excellent Capture the Flag (CTF) game to try. I've played the wargames on Over the Wire and provided simple walkthroughs in this repository to help newcomers who may get stuck. These writeups aren't complete game walkthroughs, as I believe many learners simply want guidance rather than a full step-by-step guide that may spoil the excitement of completing the CTF.

## What is Over The Wire ?
OverTheWire is a platform offering Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges, a cybersecurity training exercise. Participants engage in various wargames that involve solving progressively complex computer security puzzles. These challenges require skills like cryptography, reverse engineering, and web exploitation to discover hidden flags (tokens) that prove successful exploitation. OverTheWire's wargames range from beginner to advanced levels, providing an excellent opportunity for individuals to hone their hacking and defense skills, making it a valuable resource for cybersecurity enthusiasts and professionals alike.
